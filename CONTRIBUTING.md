# Contributing to Awesome GPT Prompt Engineering

We welcome contributions to this list! Here's how you can help:

## Adding a new resource

1. Please make sure your suggested resource is **relevant** to GPT prompt engineering. It should directly involve GPT, transformers, or language model fine-tuning.

2. We prefer resources that are **accessible for free**. However, paid resources can be included if they are of high quality.

3. Please look through the existing categories before suggesting a new one. We want to keep the list manageable and well-organized, so we may reject new categories if they're too narrow or overlap significantly with existing ones.

4. To suggest a new resource, open a new PR and follow the current README format for resources.

⚠️ THE DESCRIPTION SHOULD BE DESCRIPTIVE AND NOT CONTAIN ANY SUBJECTIVE ELEMENT SUCH AS "THE BEST <...>". ⚠️

## Improving existing resources

If you see a mistake, or think you can improve the description of an existing resource, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/username/repo/issues/new) with your suggested changes.

## Code of Conduct

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.
